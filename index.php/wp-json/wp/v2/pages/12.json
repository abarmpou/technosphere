To engage students with questions of space, place, and time, a faculty member will work with students to build a mobile app for time travel in augmented reality to examine the hidden role of technology on the UF campus. This work will lay the foundation for team-taught and other new courses that will give students the tools to envision how they will \u201cimagineer\u201d the future of the planet while harnessing the power of technologies in environmentally and socially sustainable way\n\n<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Imagineering and the Technosphere, is a a UF Intersections group funded by the Andrew W.
