It looks in particular at the role of city planners and some past urban planning projects that had the effect of brutalizing social life in urban areas. In studying these examples, we can see how the politics of fear play a major role in the shaping of urban atmosphere. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Simon David Goldhill<\/strong>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fellow_of_the_British_Academy\">FBA<\/a>\u00a0is Professor in\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Greek_Literature\">Greek Literature<\/a>\u00a0and Culture and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fellow\">fellow<\/a>\u00a0and Director of Studies in Classics at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/King%27s_College,_Cambridge\">King\u2019s College, Cambridge<\/a>.
