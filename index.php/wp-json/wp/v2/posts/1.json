The 1896 hurricane that destroyed the Gulf coastal community of Atsena Otie and the cedar mill industry on which it depended is but a faint memory of those who dwell today in the shadow of the disaster. The same could be said of a prior hurricane (1842) in the consciousness of the entrepreneur who only 13 years later sited a cedar mill industry in a place of assured future disaster. We can consider a variety of explanations for the impotence of social memory, but we might also consider ways in which historical knowledge can be rendered multisensory: literary and visual, but also experiential and interactive. Virtual realities of past events enable not only sensory experience informed by historical resources (archives, archaeology, oral history), but also the play of time and space that enables comparison, pattern recognition, and generalization (an analytical tool).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This workshop is the first opportunity to introduce for discussion the plan for constructing a virtual reality of Atsena Otie, the 1896 event that \u201cruined\u201d it, as well as the preconditions and consequences of its vulnerability to disaster. In keeping with the Grand Challenge of the Imagineering and the Technosphere group, discussion should focus on the question:&nbsp;<em>How have technologies shaped our lives, and how can we draw on them to meet 21st century challenges on a planetary scale?<\/em>&nbsp;In the case of Atsena Otie, we will consider how the cedar mill industry predisposed the area to disaster and how modern, digital technology can be used to mobilize historical knowledge about this disaster for reducing the risks of future hurricanes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"225\" height=\"225\" src=\"https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/technosphere\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/sassaman.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-73\" srcset=\"https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/technosphere\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/sassaman.jpg 225w, https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/technosphere\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/sassaman-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/technosphere\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/sassaman-100x100.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>  <br>Kenneth E.
