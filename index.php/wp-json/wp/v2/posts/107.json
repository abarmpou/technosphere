Courses he has recently taught include: \u201cWater Worlds: Cultural Responses to Sea Level Rise and Catastrophic Flooding\u201d; \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/omnia.sas.upenn.edu\/story\/writing-dark-times\">Writing in Dark Times<\/a>\u201c; \u201cThe German Connection: Hollywood and Berlin\u201d; \u201cErinnerungsorte\/Places of Memory\u201d; and \u201cWeimar Classicism.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coastal cities around the world are already contending with the effects of sea level rise. For many, the problems are exacerbated by subsidence. Cities are sinking and seas are rising. Hundreds of millions of people will be affected. Enter the Netherlands. Building on proud traditions of coastal defense, land reclamation, and water management, the Dutch avidly pursue what they call their \u201cinternational water ambition.\u201d In New York, Miami, Houston, Ho Chi Minh City, Jakarta, Dhaka, and many more, you will find the Dutch government and Dutch engineering and design companies promoting the Dutch approach. Dutch design slogans capture the range of their ambition: Rebuild by Design, Building with Nature, the Blue Revolution, the Floating City, Room for the River. The Dutch are intent on turning problems into opportunities. In this workshop, we will explore the intercultural aspects of the Dutch international water ambition in several case studies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Watch recording of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/mediasite.video.ufl.edu\/Mediasite\/Play\/a626ac3a75c848419707e598773c73f21d\">livestream.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Including discussion with Terry Harpold (English), Angela Lindner (Environmental Engineering Sciences), Chris Silver (College of Design, Construction &amp; Planning), and Les Thiele (Political Science).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Introduction by Barbara Mennel (English and German\/LLC; Director, Center for Humanities and the Public Sphere).
