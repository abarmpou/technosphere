This time travel can be used as an experiential learning tool that moves the student outside of the traditional classroom setting to explore how humans use technology to alter our physical world. During this journey students can discover what the lessons of the past inventions can teach us about how to address the problems facing humanity today, particularly as they emerge in the &#8220;technosphere,&#8221; the landscape shaped by the human hands. <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[4],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/technosphere\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/274"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/technosphere\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/technosphere\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/technosphere\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/technosphere\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=274"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/technosphere\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/274\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":275,"href":"https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/technosphere\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/274\/revisions\/275"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/technosphere\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=274"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/technosphere\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=274"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/technosphere\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=274"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
