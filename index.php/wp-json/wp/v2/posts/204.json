This presentation discusses the common elements behind these encoding schemes and showcases how these could be utilized in modern text editors by extending the traditional constraints of writing. A real-world&nbsp;application will be shown&nbsp;that demonstrates how mapping between natural languages and computer languages can be developed in order to help users learn new encoding schemes with minimal learning curve. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"313\" height=\"249\" src=\"https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/technosphere\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Russian_Braille_chart.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-214\" srcset=\"https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/technosphere\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Russian_Braille_chart.jpg 313w, https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/technosphere\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Russian_Braille_chart-300x239.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Angelos Barmpoutis is an Associate Professor in the On-Line Learning Institute and the Digital Worlds Institute at the University of Florida.
