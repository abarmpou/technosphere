She is also a founder of the two international and interdisciplinary collaborations, Visualizing Venice and the Medieval Kingdom of Sicily Image Database.&nbsp; From 1994 to 1998 Bruzelius was Director of the American Academy in Rome.&nbsp; She is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Medieval Academy of America, the Society of Antiquaries (London), and has received numerous other awards in the United States and abroad.&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tuesday, October 9th, 12-1pmLibrary West 212: Nygren Scholar\u2019s Studio Join our Intersections group&nbsp;for a conversation about how we can combine historical manuscripts and artistic renderings with ground-penetrating radar, laser scanning, 3D modeling and other digital technologies to understand and interpret material culture.
