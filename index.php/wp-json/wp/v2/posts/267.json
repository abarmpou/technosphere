During this journey students can discover what the lessons of past inventions can teach us about how to address the problems facing humanity today, particularly as they emerge in the \u201ctechnosphere,\u201d the landscape shaped by human hands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How to play:<\/strong> Use the  Time Traveler  App  to unlock and explore  new places  on UF campus. Complete the assigned task in each place to earn a 3D printed token for your game board. New destinations will be released every week of the semester. Try to complete your game board by collecting as many 3D tokens as you can, including the bonus ones.  <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Using an old aerial photograph of the UF campus as a map and a GPS app as a guide, students and faculty engage in a unique adventure through space and time.
