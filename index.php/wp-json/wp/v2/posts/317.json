The paper draws upon a dissertation chapter in which I contend Emerson goes beyond just casual allusion to and incorporation of concepts drawn from astronomy and optics and instead offers a causal theory that points to a material process of transcendental inspiration akin to spiritualism\u2019s use of the ether as a basis for \u2018contact\u2019 with departed souls later in the century (cf. Moffet\u2019s \u201cSwept Over an Etheric Niagara\u201d JLS 2015). I balance this abstracted theory against its practice, particularly a passage from his journals in which Emerson laments his inability to make direct contact with his \u201choly fraternity\u201d of friends leading him to state \u201cBut so the remoter stars seem a nebula of united light, yet there is no group which a telescope will not resolve: And the dearest friends are separated by irreconcilable intervals,\u201d a sentiment that stipulates the necessity for a connecting medium. In proposing a mechanism for his utopic form of individual, momentary transcendence\u2014by no means permanent with the fleeting instances of revolutionary inspiration zapped from mind to mind and spirit to spirit (cf. Mastroianni\u2019s \u201cMoods and the Secret Cause of Revolution in Emerson\u201d chapter of Politics and Skepticism in Antebellum American Literature)\u2014Emerson is attempting to co-opt popular excitement surrounding astronomy\u2019s nineteenth-century discoveries by offering a genre- and natural history-inflected version of the inductive method and in the process reclaims literature\u2019s constitutive function in public meaning-making.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Technosphere working group\u2019s \u201cHow have technologies shaped our lives, and how do we draw on them to meet 21st century challenges?\u201d grand challenge question invites inquiries into the ways that technology channels human perception and forms practices.&nbsp; My research interests run along parallel rails by seeking to read the texts of Margaret Fuller, Ralph &hellip; <\/p>\n<p class=\"link-more\"><a href=\"https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/technosphere\/index.php\/2019\/09\/12\/andrew-jenkins\/\" class=\"more-link\">Continue reading<span class=\"screen-reader-text\"> &#8220;Andrew Jenkins&#8221;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[7],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/technosphere\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/317"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/technosphere\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/technosphere\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/technosphere\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/technosphere\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=317"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/technosphere\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/317\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":319,"href":"https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/technosphere\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/317\/revisions\/319"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/technosphere\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=317"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/technosphere\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=317"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/technosphere\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=317"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
