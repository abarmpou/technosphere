Exertion games have been widely utilized by researchers to improve children\u2019s motivation to participate in physical activity, since children are likely to spend more time engaged in sedentary activities [1]. Furthermore, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise activity [2]. A major challenge faced by researchers in the field of exergames is that children are not motivated to use these games after the initial novelty of the game wears off. The aim of my project is to improve children\u2019s motivation to exercise using exertion games by improving their interactive experiences within the games. Prior work has found that that the precision of motion recognition systems used in exertion games is associated with increased immersion in the game [3]. Therefore, I plan to improve the effectiveness of motion recognition systems in recognizing children\u2019s motions. Currently, my approach focuses on distinguishing children\u2019s motions from adults\u2019 motions in order to understand the motion qualities that are unique to children. The ultimate goal of my project is to improve children\u2019s willingness to participate in exercise activities in order to satisfy the recommended number of hours that children should engage in physical activity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>References<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Jane Gould. 2013.
