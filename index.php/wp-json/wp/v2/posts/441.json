More specifically, engaging with the goal of the&nbsp;<em>Intersections<\/em>&nbsp;group, the workshop aims at familiarizing the audience with digital storytelling, a digital technology that lends itself to be used as an educational, research, and social-interaction tool. The participants will be actively introduced to the possibilities that WeVideo, a video editing platform, affords to researchers and especially instructors, and will reflect on ways in which they can incorporate and utilize digital storytelling in their classes to facilitate critical discussions and creative thinking, especially at a time when online classes are our daily reality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anastasia Pantazopoulou<\/strong>&nbsp;is a PhD candidate in Classics at the University of Florida. She holds a BA in Philology majoring in Classics (2013), and an MA in Ancient Greek Philology (2015) from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece.
