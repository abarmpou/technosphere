<p>Led by Anastasia Pantazopoulou, the “Imagineering Stories” workshop is centered around digital technologies which have transformed the way we conceptualize and tell stories creating a space where anyone can express themselves. More specifically, engaging with the goal of the&nbsp;<em>Intersections</em>&nbsp;group, the workshop aims at familiarizing the audience with digital storytelling, a digital technology that lends itself to be used as an educational, research, and social-interaction tool. The participants will be actively introduced to the possibilities that WeVideo, a video editing platform, affords to researchers and especially instructors, and will reflect on ways in which they can incorporate and utilize digital storytelling in their classes to facilitate critical discussions and creative thinking, especially at a time when online classes are our daily reality.</p>



<p><strong>Anastasia Pantazopoulou</strong>&nbsp;is a PhD candidate in Classics at the University of Florida. She holds a BA in Philology majoring in Classics (2013), and an MA in Ancient Greek Philology (2015) from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece. She is an alumna of the American Academy in Rome CSS, an Intersections-Mellon Grant doctoral student for the 2018-2021 academic years, and a UF Graduate Student Teaching Award recipient for the 2017-2018 academic year. Her research interests include ancient Greek and Roman drama, and metatheater, classical reception, digital humanities, performance studies, and public scholarship.</p>



<p>This workshop is free. However, attendance is limited to 29 participants.&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeOuYFy-pZDsA5IhfeWZvIAkdN7bgwolp7347I7hSR_U05_OA/viewform">Please click here to register by December 7.</a>&nbsp;Registration will be on a first come, first serve basis.

<p>At Google, we believe that artificial intelligence can provide new ways of approaching problems and meaningfully improve people’s lives. That’s why we’re excited to support organizations that are using the power of AI to address social and environmental challenges.&nbsp;Google.org issued an open call to organizations around the world to submit their ideas for how they could use AI to help address societal challenges.&nbsp;We looked for projects across a range of social impact domains and levels of technical expertise, from organizations that are experienced in AI to those with an idea for how they could put their data to better use.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this lecture I will&nbsp;talk about this&nbsp;program and&nbsp;speak about my personal experience working on it. </p>

<p><strong> Wednesday, November 13, 2019, 10:00 am </strong></p>



<p> The past has a tenuous, often contentious, relationship with the future. We fragment and sequester the past, drawing memory from only those things we have at hand and rupturing continuities with the present by forgetting. Futures discounting exacerbates this myopic condition by playing on uncertainties to diminish the wisdom of looking too far ahead. How can digital technologies help bridge the past with the future? Examples from digital storytelling, augmented and virtual reality, and spatialized archives enable us to explore the potential for hetereotemporality, nonlinear histories, and the power of ruins and artifacts&nbsp;to experience&nbsp;other times and places. Workshop participants are invited to share their own efforts with&nbsp;digital technologies for repurposing the past for the future. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="225" src="https://abarmpou.github.io/technosphere/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Shannon-Dawdy.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-331"/></figure></div>



<p>Shannon Lee Dawdy is a Professor of Anthropology and of Social Sciences in the College,&nbsp;University&nbsp;of&nbsp;Chicago. Her fieldwork combines archival, ethnographic, and archaeological methods with a regional focus on the coastal communities of the U.S., Caribbean, and Mexico. The central thread running through her work concerns how landscapes and material objects mediate human relationships, whether this means an examination of the historical ecologies of capitalism, or the emotional trajectories of those who lost their intimate object worlds to Hurricane Katrina. She also has a strong interest in questions of temporality (past, present, future). She has written a couple of quite different books on New Orleans. Her current research (which will take the form of both a film and a book) focuses on rapidly changing death practices in the U.S., particularly around disposition and transformation of the body. She is interested in what these emerging practice say about popular ontologies. </p>

<p>The debris pile from 134,000 New Orleans buildings damaged or destroyed by Hurricane Katrina is visible from space. Although there was some effort to recycle materials through a little-known global market in demolition debris, most of the rubble amassed in place. In the future, archaeologists might reasonably consider the hurricane landfill a monumental structure. In the 1970s, Bill Rathje boldly suggested that an archaeological approach to contemporary life can reveal things about ourselves that we didn’t know. Modern landfills were his field sites. This talk thinks through Rathje’s garbology and the exceptionalism of disaster sites. Contestations reveal how important the management of debris and its ideological effects are to local and national governments. Trash is political. And politics is an assemblage of the human and the non-human, the intentional and the accidental.​ </p>

<p> This lecture examines how we might understand the relationship between urban infrastructures, and the logics of exclusion and inclusion around which the category of citizenship is understood and cultural identities are formed. It looks in particular at the role of city planners and some past urban planning projects that had the effect of brutalizing social life in urban areas. In studying these examples, we can see how the politics of fear play a major role in the shaping of urban atmosphere. </p>

<p><strong> Friday, October 18, 10:40-11:40AM –Dauer 219  (Ruth McQuown Room) </strong></p>



<p> The Palatine Anthology is a collection of Greek poems (epigrams) that were discovered in the early 17<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century. The material included in the manuscripts are narratives originating from between 7th BCE to late antiquity. &nbsp;The manuscripts are currently housed at the Library of the University of Heidelberg (click here to review the&nbsp;<a href="https://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/cpgraec23/0011/image">digital archive</a>). This workshop is about why and how the Palatine Anthology is not read as an anthology but is instead cut up and redistributed — to the extent that the Teubner &nbsp;(<em>Bibliotheca Scriptorum Graecorum et Romanorum Teubneriana)&nbsp;</em>does not even print book 8, and the standard work on it (Cameron) does not mention four of the fifteen books. </p>

<p>

Based on examples from Genesis, the Gospel according to John, and the Bible-translation of Martin Luther and his own comments about it – on which my main attention is focused, I explore in this workshop the validity of the proposition that culture generally and within it the technosphere – at least the part of it pertaining to crucial occidental employments of languages and literatures – might be described or circumscribed in terms of an always-ongoing madeness/making of things. With the help of the above sources (mainly Luther), I will explore whether such descriptive/circumscriptive terms might be made somewhat more precise binarily or “digitally” as relations of eternal and immediate, infinite and infinitesimal.
