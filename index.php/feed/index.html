<p>Led by Anastasia Pantazopoulou, the “Imagineering Stories” workshop is centered around digital technologies which have transformed the way we conceptualize and tell stories creating a space where anyone can express themselves. More specifically, engaging with the goal of the&nbsp;<em>Intersections</em>&nbsp;group, the workshop aims at familiarizing the audience with digital storytelling, a digital technology that lends itself to be used as an educational, research, and social-interaction tool. The participants will be actively introduced to the possibilities that WeVideo, a video editing platform, affords to researchers and especially instructors, and will reflect on ways in which they can incorporate and utilize digital storytelling in their classes to facilitate critical discussions and creative thinking, especially at a time when online classes are our daily reality.</p>



<p><strong>Anastasia Pantazopoulou</strong>&nbsp;is a PhD candidate in Classics at the University of Florida. She holds a BA in Philology majoring in Classics (2013), and an MA in Ancient Greek Philology (2015) from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece. She is an alumna of the American Academy in Rome CSS, an Intersections-Mellon Grant doctoral student for the 2018-2021 academic years, and a UF Graduate Student Teaching Award recipient for the 2017-2018 academic year. Her research interests include ancient Greek and Roman drama, and metatheater, classical reception, digital humanities, performance studies, and public scholarship.</p>



<p>This workshop is free. However, attendance is limited to 29 participants.&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeOuYFy-pZDsA5IhfeWZvIAkdN7bgwolp7347I7hSR_U05_OA/viewform">Please click here to register by December 7.</a>&nbsp;Registration will be on a first come, first serve basis.

<p>The student-led portal haveuheard.com lists our <strong>Imagineering the Technosphere</strong> class as one of the elective courses that student wish to take. </p>



<p>More specifically the say: &#8220;Today, universities have students declare a major almost immediately. That’s not to say they cannot change their major but, once a student is following their course track, it can become more difficult to switch as they progress further into their major. And for those students that love their major, they often opt to take other classes within their college major instead of exploring all the different electives that are available. But, sometimes students’ schedules are just so stress-packed that an easy, fun, and exciting elective is the perfect way to round out a schedule. Electives can serve many purposes: fulfill an individual’s major requirement, supplement more rigorous courses to complete a minor, fill a schedule, or simply to have great fun.&nbsp;&#8220;</p>



<p><strong>Imagineering the Technosphere</strong> is one of these wish-you-took electives!</p>

<p>The UF Quest Game that was created as part of our Imagineering the Technosphere project was featured on March 11, 2020 in EdScoop, an on-line news outlet for education.</p>



<p>The article was titled “Immersive app turns U. of Florida campus into educational board game” and provided a detailed presentation of the project: “The game, part of a class called “Imagineering the Technosphere,” taps into an app called Time Traveler that uses GPS to navigate students around campus and bestow historical insights into the locations they visit, such as museums, research facilities and event venues. Upon arrival at each location, the app presents historical information and later poses a question that tests students’ comprehension of the information presented. The app also ties into a corresponding physical board game in which students compete against each other for 3D-printed pieces that correspond to the locations visited. ”</p>

<p>Our Imagineering the Techosphere class was featured on March 6, 2020 in UF news.</p>



<p>The article was titled “UF class turns campus into an interactive game” and provided a detailed presentation of our class and its innovative UF Quest game. According to the article: &#8230;in the humanities class “Imagineering the Technosphere,” homework isn’t based on a book chapter, but an adventure through campus guided by the GPS-powered Time Traveler app. </p>

<p>At Google, we believe that artificial intelligence can provide new ways of approaching problems and meaningfully improve people’s lives. That’s why we’re excited to support organizations that are using the power of AI to address social and environmental challenges.&nbsp;Google.org issued an open call to organizations around the world to submit their ideas for how they could use AI to help address societal challenges.&nbsp;We looked for projects across a range of social impact domains and levels of technical expertise, from organizations that are experienced in AI to those with an idea for how they could put their data to better use.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this lecture I will&nbsp;talk about this&nbsp;program and&nbsp;speak about my personal experience working on it. </p>
